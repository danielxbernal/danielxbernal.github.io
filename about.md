Hello, I am a first year student at The University of Texas in Austin studying computer science. I am working towards a bachelor's and should be done around May 2023. My interests are naturally drawn to artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

### More Information

I enjoy many other things besides software. To name a few, I like to dance, play soccer, and draw.
